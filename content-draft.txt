About me
I'm Swiss wolf named PhirosWolf, I really like programming, maths, everything that touches to logic, art and music. I'm also a Rust enthusiast. Data privacy and the principles stated in the Mozilla Manifesto matters to me. I speak French, English and I'm currently learning Russian.

I worked with many programming languages over the years. Here's a list of the languages I learned sorted by order of mastery.
